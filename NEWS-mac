* emacs-24.1-mac-3.0 (2012-06-10)
Based on Emacs 24.1.

** Fixed bugs

*** The `page-curl' transition does not look right on Mac OS X 10.5.

*** Wrong display of the backside image for the
`page-curl-with-shadow' transition on Mac OS X 10.7 with HiDPI mode.

*** Wrong display of animations on Mac OS X 10.5 and 10.6 when
resolution independence is in effect.

*** Incomplete input area (aka "active input area", "marked text", or
"preedit area") does not respect buffer text scaling.
Apply Chong Yidong's fix for Bug#2066.


* emacs-24.1-rc-mac-2.94 [experimental/hackers-only] (2012-06-01)
Based on Emacs 24.1 release candidate
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2012-06/msg00009.html

** Improvements

*** Animation now supports the built-in Core Image transition filters
via Core Animation.  The "About Emacs" and "Preferences..." menu items
in the application menu (labeled "Emacs") in the menu bar are
accompanied with a transition animation effect on Mac OS X 10.5 and
later.  Animation is suppressed if the frame is not completely opaque,
because it does not give an intended effect on such frames.

Known issues: The `page-curl' transition does not look right on Mac OS
X 10.5.  Also, the `page-curl-with-shadow' transition does not look
right for some angles on Mac OS X 10.7.4.  Both transitions look
blurry on Mac OS X 10.7.4 with HiDPI mode.

** Fixed bugs

*** HiDPI mode gives a blurry magnified text look on Mac OS X 10.7.3.

*** HiDPI mode shows wrong animation on transition from/to full screen.

*** M-x electric-pair-mode RET gives the warning "Note, built-in
variable `imagemagick-render-type' not bound".
Reported by Leo.

*** Tooltip place adjustment does not take account of multiple
monitors.
Reported by Pavel Martynenko.

*** Drag-and-drop highlight is not displayed just after exiting from
full screen.

*** Momentum scroll events after horizontal flicking interfere with a
multi-key sequence.

*** "Emacs" (in the menu bar) -> "About Emacs" then typing "q" causes
an error.

** Improvements

*** Support right-to-left text shaping.

*** New variable `mac-system-move-file-to-trash-use-finder', which
enables us to use the Finder for trashing so we can `Put Back' the
trashed items from the context menu.

*** Buffer switching by horizontal swiping/flicking and exiting from
the splash screen are accompanied with an experimental simple
animation effect on Mac OS X 10.5 and later.


* emacs-24.0.94-mac-2.90 [experimental/hackers-only] (2012-03-03)
Based on Emacs 24.0.94.  Drop support for Mac OS X 10.2 and 10.3.
Be aware of the (platform-independent) change in selection:
mouse-dragging no longer automatically copies the selected text to the
clipboard without M-w or `Copy' in the menu bar or the tool bar,
unless you set `mouse-drag-copy-region' to t.
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2012-03/msg00030.html

** Fixed bugs

*** If compiled with ARC, "Emacs" (in the menu bar) -> "About Emacs"
leads to crash.

*** Emacs -q --eval "(set-frame-parameter nil 'fullscreen 'fullboth)"
does not hide the menu bar.
Reported by Leo.

** Improvements

*** New image type `image-io', which is parallel to `imagemagick' but
uses the Image I/O framework.  If not configured to link with the
ImageMagick library, then `image-io' provides a fallback
implementation of the `imagemagick' image type.

*** The variable `tool-bar-style' works like in GTK+.  The values
`both-horiz', `text-image-horiz' are synonymous with `both'.

*** Flicking either a touch-sensitive mouse with one finger or a
trackpad with two fingers horizontally issues a swipe-left/swipe-right
event, which is now bound to a simple buffer switching by default.

*** Wrong relief display for sliced images.
Adapt a fix for Bug#10500.

** Improvements

*** If Emacs.app is launched from Finder or via Resume, and there is
no ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist file, then it inherits environment
variable settings of user's login shell.  Note that if Emacs.app is
launched via the `open' command on Mac OS X 10.4 and later, then it
inherits environment variable settings of the shell where the command
is invoked, and this behavior is unchanged.

** Fixed bugs

*** The cursor is sometimes unerased.  This bug is not
platform-specific, but happens more frequently on Mac OS X 10.7.
Apply a fix for Bug#9415.

*** Crash when a separator is displayed in the tool bar on Mac OS X
10.7.

*** Can't toggle tool bar visibility for maximized frames on Mac OS X
10.7.

*** While executing AppleScript, pressing the down arrow key is
misinterpreted as `C-_' (usually bound to the undo command).
Reported by Leo.

*** Memory leak by y-or-n-p-with-timeout with GUI (Bug#9830).

** Improvements

*** Can compile with ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) on Xcode 4.2.
Specify CC="clang -fobjc-arc" on configure.

*** When running Ediff on a fullboth frame, it no longer gets obscured
by the menu bar or the Dock even if we focus Ediff Control Panel.

*** Unlike fullboth frames, fullscreen frames no longer occupy the
whole desktop area on Mac OS X 10.7 when the desktop width/height is
not a multiple of the nominal character width/height, respectively.

** Fixed bugs

*** Devanagari string U+0936 U+094D U+0930 U+093F (3 consonants
followed by 1 vowel, but the glyph corresponding to the last vowel
should be displayed first) is displayed wrong and may cause hang.
Reported by Tsuyoshi YASUMA.

*** Executables compiled on Mac OS X 10.6 with
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.5 do not run on Mac OS X 10.5.  This is a
regression introduced in 1.9994.
Note: executables compiled on Mac OS X 10.7 with
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.6 and some optimization flag still do not
run on Mac OS X 10.6, but I think this is a bug about weak linking in
the compiler or linker in Xcode 4.1 and already reported to Apple.

*** Updating display while a frame is resized from the bottom-right
corner does not work via Screen Sharing.  This is a regression
introduced in 1.9993.

*** Updating display while a frame is resized does not work from
non-bottom-right corners or edges on Mac OS X 10.7.

*** Some CPU consumption is observed even if executed with -Q -D (no
timer for cursor blinking) and M-x tool-bar-mode RET on Mac OS X 10.7.

** Fixed bugs

*** SVG display by WebKit is disabled on 64-bit executables.

*** The "Special Characters ..." item in the "Edit" menu doesn't
appear in non-English locales.

*** LastResort font is not shown on Mac OS X 10.7.

*** Pointer shape around the edges/corners becomes the pointing arrow
rather than the resizing arrows on Mac OS X 10.7 when mouse moved.

** Improvements

*** Support for the full screen mode introduced in Mac OS X 10.7.
Now `fullscreen' and `fullboth' values for the `fullscreen' frame
parameter have different meanings on Mac OS X 10.7: the former means a
new system-wide full screen mode with a dedicated desktop (or Space),
and the latter means the existing fullscreen feature.

Known issues: the menu bar does not appear with Control-F2 or
Command-Shift-/, and the tool bar is shown when mouse is moved to the
top even when tool-bar-mode is turned off.  I think these are bugs
(already reported to Apple), and I'd like to see if the situation
is changed with some future OS updates rather than tweaking with some
workarounds.

*** On Mac OS X 10.7, double-tapping either a touch-sensitive mouse
with one finger or a trackpad with two fingers changes the buffer text
scaling to unscaled if previously scaled.  And if previously unscaled,
then the buffer text is scaled so the default font occupies at least
`mac-text-scale-standard-width' columns in the tapped window.

** Improvements

*** Color bitmap fonts such as Apple Color Emoji can be displayed if
compiled and run on Mac OS X 10.7.

*** Drag-and-drop highlights the frame under the pointer.

*** Option key temporarily inverts the "Jump to the spot that's
clicked" setting for scroll bars as in other applications.

*** Option key temporarily changes the behavior of line-up/down scroll
bar buttons to page-up/down as in other applications.

*** Holding shift key on startup is recognized as -Q option.

** Notes

*** This release is meant to make minimal adjustment for Mac OS X
10.7.  Don't expect integration with new features of Lion except the
color emoji display support mentioned above.

*** SVG support by WebKit is disabled on 64-bit executables for now,
because it may hang while initializing plugins in some cases.  If you
do need SVG display, then build as a 32-bit executable or use librsvg.

*** Fullscreen frame does not hide the Dock that is on a different
screen from the one containing the menu bar.
Note: we cannot hide only the menu bar while showing the Dock.  So the
Dock might be hidden even when the fullscreen frame is not on the

** Fixed bugs

*** Text scaling by pinch out/in and by C-x C-+/C-- are not in sync.

*** Shift-Tab is recognized as Tab, and keyboard navigation after
Command-Shift-/ doesn't work on Mac OS X 10.6.  These are regressions
caused by the previous fix for the DefaultKeyBinding.dict problem.

*** Successive paste of the same image from other applications via the
clipboard causes duplication in the kill ring.  Reported by Leo.  This
is a regression caused by the previous fix.

*** Fonts in highlighted words with the pop-up dictionary
(Command-Control-D) are sometimes incorrect.  This is a regression
caused by refactoring for the accessibility support.

** Improvements

*** Font design destination can be specified via the `:destination'
font property.  The value 1 means the destination is video text as in
the XLFD Conventions, and screen font metrics are used in that case.
You can see the difference with (make-frame '((font
. "Monaco-9:antialias=off:destination=1"))), for example.

need to be typed multiple times.  Reported by Peter Dyballa and Drew Hess.

*** Successive paste of different images from other applications via
the clipboard only inserts the first image.  Reported by Leo.

*** Successive SVG image loading in `vrend-clock' by Anders Waldenborg
(http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-emacs/2010-05/msg00521.html)
fails in a few seconds.

*** The variable `face-ignored-fonts' does not work.
Apply Kenichi Handa's fix for Bug#6287.
This is useful when you want to turn off synthetic bold for some fonts
like (add-to-list 'face-ignored-fonts "\\`-[^-]*-monaco-bold-").
Synthetic bold seems to become lighter if the background is darker
than the foreground and the LCD font smoothing is turned on.

** Improvements

*** "Speak selected text with when the key is pressed", which can be
customized in the Speech pane in the System Preferences, now works.

*** New events: magnify-up/down and rotate-left/right.  They are for
newer trackpads with Mac OS X 10.5.2 and later.  By default,
magnify-up/down, which are issued by pinch out/in, are bound to
scaling text size by text-scale-mode.  With the shift key, they turn
on/off fullscreen status of the frame.

*** Experimental support for accessibility with respect to the custom
view for Emacs frames.  Still there are several glitches.

*** Can't quit while establishing a TCP connection.
Apply a fix for Bug#5723 as well as Helmut Eller's fix for Bug#5173.

** Improvements

*** When a maximized frame is moved with title bar dragging on a
multiple monitor environment, the destination monitor is determined by
the mouse position at the end of dragging.  If such a frame is moved
programmatically, the destination monitor is determined by the maximum
area of the contained part of the frame as before.

*** Menu item "Open Selected File in Emacs" is shown in Services or
context menu of other applications by default on Mac OS X 10.6 when
absolute pathname-like text is selected.

*** Emacs info nodes are accessible via search field in the Help menu

has non-zero internal border width.

** Improvements

*** When the clipboard has both textual and image data, yank inserts
the former and push both into the kill ring so the latter can be
inserted with yank-pop afterwards.

*** Use non-integral x positions for displaying antialiased
proportional fonts.  You can see the difference by putting the box
cursor over Helvetica 12pt `I', whose ideal width is 3.33398 but

*** The current cursor position may be returned for a character
position query for text input even if the marked text is not displayed
or handled at the Lisp level yet (so auxiliary windows in AquaSKK 4
are placed better.)

*** SVG images are supported via WebKit on Mac OS X 10.4 and later.
If you have librsvg installed and you want to use WebKit for rendering
SVG images, then you need to specify --without-rsvg as a configure
option.

*** The Mac font backend driver now supports `get_variation_glyphs'
also on Mac OS X 10.4 and earlier.

*** Ideographic Variation Sequences (IVSes) also work for Hiragino
fonts, which don't have a format 14 (Unicode Variation Sequences)
subtable in their cmap table.


* emacs-23.1-mac-1.93 [experimental/hackers-only] (2009-09-27)
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2009-09/msg00745.html

** Fixed bugs

*** Conversion between Lisp and NSPasteboard strings doesn't preserve
NUL characters.

*** Mouse face reacts even while tracking Dock menus or Stacks.

*** Control-Q does not work as the quote binding in file dialogs.

*** Synthetic bold does not work for bitmap-only fonts on Mac OS X
10.6.

** Improvements

*** New events: wheel-left/right as in W32, and
swipe-up/down/left/right on Mac OS X 10.5.2 and later.

*** The Mac font backend driver now supports `get_variation_glyphs' on
Mac OS X 10.5 and later.  You need some OpenType font containing a
format 14 (Unicode Variation Sequences) subtable in its cmap table.

*** Simplified `select' emulation also for Mac OS X 10.5 and earlier.
Its design is similar to the one in the previous release with Grand
Central Dispatch.

http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2009-09/msg00105.html

** Fixed bugs

*** Command-Control-D doesn't pop up dictionary on Mac OS X 10.6.

*** Iconified frames aren't considered visible.
Reported by Benjamin Riefenstahl.

*** Can't make iconified frames invisible.

** Improvements

*** Fall back on mac-system-coding-system if script and language
information is not available in text input events.

*** New implementation for the `select' emulation using Grand Central
Dispatch instead of CFSocket.  It is enabled by default if built for
Mac OS X 10.6.  If you find it unstable/problematic, then you can turn
it off by compiling with "-DSELECT_USE_GCD=0".

http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2009-08/msg01309.html

** Fixed bugs

*** Doesn't build on Mac OS X 10.6.

*** Multi-page TIFF images are not supported.
I thought they were, but I actually added the code to another working
tree and forgot to merge it in the previous version.

*** "Visit New File" shows a wrong dialog.
Apply Jason Rumney's fix for Bug#3969.

*** Mach port right leaks due to the previous change for the warning
"CFMessagePort: bootstrap_register(): failed".

** Improvements

*** File and font dialogs can be closed with C-g on Mac OS X 10.5 and later.


* emacs-23.1-mac-1.90 [experimental/hackers-only] (2009-08-03)
Based on Emacs 23.1.  Rename from "Carbon+AppKit port" to "Mac port".
Drop support for Mac OS X 10.1 and earlier.
Drop GUI implementation with Carbon HIToolbox.
Revamp font handing completely.

* emacs-22.3-appkit-1.5 (2009-08-03)
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2009-08/msg00091.html

** Fixed bugs

*** "open -g" (available on Mac OS X 10.5 and later) does not work.

*** Control-Tab is not recognized on Mac OS X 10.4 and earlier.

** Improvements

*** Resizing truncates the window width/height to multiple of the
nominal character size instead of rounding unless the resizing is
triggered by mouse dragging of the resize handle.

*** Warning "CFMessagePort: bootstrap_register(): failed" with
multiple invocations via command-line or "open -n" is suppressed
(except for Mac OS X 10.4).


* emacs-22.3-appkit-1.4 (2009-06-27)
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2009-06/msg00532.html

** Fixed bugs

*** Fringe bitmap display is incorrect if its width is not 8.

*** Crash when calculating Quickdraw font metrics in an invisible frame.

*** Crash when changing internal-border-width of an invisible frame.

*** Assertion failure in mac_set_font.

*** "Hide" in Login Items does not work. 

*** (mac-pasteboard-string-to-string "\342\204\246" 'mac-roman) gives
GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA instead of OHM SIGN (likewise for
mac-utxt-to-string).

*** mac-symbol -> emacs-mule mapping is represented wrong for #x30 - #x37.

** Improvements

*** Conversion between CFNumber and Lisp objects now uses Lisp strings
for integers that don't fit in the Lisp float range.


* emacs-22.3-appkit-1.3 (2009-03-27)
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2009-03/msg00485.html

** Fixed bugs

*** Popup dialog button labels may get corrupted.
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2009-03/msg00261.html

*** Popup dialog does not select the default item with the return key.

*** Tooltip contents are sometimes not shown on 10.4 due to the
previous change for flyspell-small-region slowness.

** Improvements

*** Hourglass (progress indicator) is shown in the title bar.

*** Add f20 and kp-separator to the keycode-to-xkeysym table.


* emacs-22.3-appkit-1.2 (2009-01-24)
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2009-01/msg00753.html

** Fixed bugs

*** do-applescript crashes with -nw due to the previous fix for
(do-applescript "choose file") hang.

*** Cursor erasure sometimes fails on Mac OS X 10.5 due to the
previous change for flyspell-small-region slowness.

*** Buffer overrun in creation of Vmac_carbon_version_string.

** Improvements

*** Untag Lisp_Object by subtraction instead of masking.
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2008-01/msg01876.html

*** `select' emulation waits for user signal delivery as well as
window system events and process outputs via sockets.
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2008-10/msg00198.html

*** Hourglass display is enabled.

*** Let the framework decide whether wheel events to non-focus frames
are accepted or not.


* emacs-22.3-appkit-1.1 (2008-11-27)
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2008-11/msg00993.html

** Fixed bugs

*** 64-bit binary doesn't work with AquaSKK Japanese input method.

*** Tooltip contents are chopped off if the fractional part of the
scaling factor is greater than or equal to 0.5.

*** Crash with tooltip autodisplay that happens when its contents are
not yet ready.

*** (do-applescript "choose file") -> cancel -> hang on 10.5.

*** With asynchronous subprocesses, the "[Complete, but not unique]"
message shown by C-x C-f / TAB TAB will disappear on key release.
(Both Carbon and Carbon+Appkit)

*** Crash with tabbar.el (not specific to the Carbon(+AppKit) port).
http://emacsbugs.donarmstrong.com/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1337

** Improvements

*** Execution of flyspell-small-region is no longer too slow.

*** The "Visit New File" dialog no longer confirms replacement if an
existing file is specified (only on 10.3 and later).

*** Update display while the resize control (or the slider in the font
panel) is being dragged.

*** Align key bindings shown in a menu.

*** Explicitly link with libncurses.5 if MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET <
1040 to avoid runtime link error when running on the versions without
/usr/lib/libncurses.5.4.dylib.
